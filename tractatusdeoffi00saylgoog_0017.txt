x INTRODUCTION.

highest honour ol all is the approval ol G0d; well-
measured praise lrom a good man is also a real honour:
but to seek honour without regard to virtue is to liken
ourselves to the figtree cursed by Christ. Yet this vain
pursuit of mere worldly honour is especially rife among
learned bodies (in castris scholasticis).

So much by way of prelude: Wyclil now attacks his
main point os the relative honour due to kings and
priests, and at the outset has to sace a formidable diffi-
culty. Alter the disappearance of Count Baldwin of
F landers his brother Henry reigned as Emperor at
Constantinople in his stead, well and wisely enough.
But in the Church os St. Sophia he had the temerity to
place the Patriarch os Constantinople on his lest hand
and apparently on a lower seat (iuxta scabellum pedum
suorum in sinistra parte). This outrage drew down on
him a vehement reproof from Pope Innocent ΙΙΙ (the
Pope to whom King John had to surrender his crown)‚
and this reprool in which the sacerdotal pretensions are
very strongly stated, was enshrined in the Decretals.
‘Now in considering this decree,’ says Wyclil, ‘we must
be on our guard against its ignorant interpreters ;’ in
other words he proceeds to meet it bya series of dis-
tinctions. Thus it is granted that the priestly order
excels the kingly, but in a special, not in a secular or
civil sense. The priestly dignity can be honoured by
God solelyper accadens, quite apart from the infinitely
higher claim to honour which virtue may conser on it.
And is the Patriarch is to be honoured with outward
observance in proportion to his priestly dignity, then no
seat will be good enough for so great a man! But
while the Pope and clergy owe their endowments to ,
emperors and kings they must be subject to them in all
temporal matters; their superiority is solely spiritual
and lies in the call made upon them to live a humbler
and more Christlike lile, and it is no more impossible
for them to be at once superior and subject than to be,
