to our treatise having followed immediately upon its
predecessor. Thus the controversy as to the privileges
of the Sanctuary of Westminster¹ is twice alluded to
(pp. 157 and 169), but in a manner which allows us to
imagine that at the time Wyclif was writing public
interest on the subject had greatly subsided. The
schism in the papacy is several times mentioned (pp.
120,17; 121,13; 123, 6; 126, 31; 219, 253 226, 7).
The first of these references shows that Urban’s Bull of
November 1378 had already been issued; in the second
there is a difficulty in the text which may lead to slightly
different views. According to our MSS. Wyclif writes:
et revera latet uos utrum ipse [sc. Robertus Gibornensi5‚
i. e. Clement VII] vel Gregorius XI* occupat palei·
monium Ceisti iniustius. lt has been suggested that
Gregorius XP‘· is here a slip of the pen for Urbanus
Vsu, in which case Wyclif at the time of writing was
already disabused of the good hopes of Urban which he
had conceived at the time of his election. On the other
hand a few lines further down Urban is distinctly
spoken of as papa noster, and it seems at least possible
to construe the text as it stands taking its meaning to
be: ‘and it is hard to say whether the present Anti·
pope is a worse usurper than was his legitimate prede-
cessor! In any case the difference of date cannot be
important, for in one passage of the De Ecclesia Wyclif
had already classed Pope and Antipope together as s
duo pseudomonachi. The remaining references to the
schism are quite general in terms, and an allusion to the
poor soldiers still unransomed in Spain perfectly har-
monizes with the date 1379 which the connexion of
this eighth book of the Seuueua with its immediate
predecessor inclines us to assign to it.

¹ For a full account of this see Dr. Loserth's introduction to the De
Ecclesia. The breach of the Abbey’s privilege of sanctuary took place on
August 11th, 1 ι178. On the 18th of the following October Wyclif laid
before the Parliament at Gloucestera memorial in which he defended the
action of the Govemment.
