is committed unto them by God is proved by the per-
mission Satan sought to injure Job, and the words of
Christ to Pilate. True that when these rulers sin
against God we must faithfully resist them to the death,
but their offences against men should be borne patiently‚
and the result he left in God’s hands. Thus we may
conclude generally that resistance to royal authority is
a grievous sin, nor is it less clear that kings have a right

to tribute srom their subjects‚ and specially from the a

state of the Church agrees ill with these conclusions‚
and it is not unreasonable to see in this the chies cause

which is unto God. Thus the true dignity of the priest .
is superior to the earthly dignity of the king, but out-

rendered more sreely to kings ¹than to priests Even
with bad kings this must continue the case, for though
they are kings only equivocally and without possessing
real lordship‚ yet they are rational creatures in whom a

maintain that the Church can carry on her warfare
without a king but not without priests sorget not only
the kingly relation within the soul, but that in such
times as the Church was without a civil king she was
