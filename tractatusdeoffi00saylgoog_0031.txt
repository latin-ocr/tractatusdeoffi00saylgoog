xxiv INTRODUCTION.

Lastly, Wyclif again approaches the question of the'
obedience due srom Bishops to their secular Prince.
For this, he shows, we have the example not only os the
priests os the Old Testament but os Christ and his·
Apostles, examples which are ensorced in the teaching
oi St. Gregory. But our modern prelates deride Christ's
humility‚ and woe to the land where these men have
rule. The three laws proposed in Chapter Vll are
again put iorward as the only means os averting national'
destruction.

ln Chapter XI (pp. 245-260) a third principal objec-
tion is considered ; this time a most comprehensive one.
A King's work, it is held, is to fight and win dominion,
and since there is no reason why one person capable oi ,
acquiring universal dominion should hold it rather than
another, any one competitor may fight with any other.
To this plea ior anarchy Wyclif answers with the
assertion oi the principles that the body politic must
have one head, that two men cannot be in all respects li
equally fitted ior headship, and that Nature does not
produce a fit man sor him to be wasted. The assump-

The unity we need is not a unity obtained by common
subjection to a single individual, but that which
follows srom the continual presence in the human race
of the genus ol divinely endowed captains. ln the
political community reason declares that each people
should have its own head, as we in England have our

ὁ King. As for the Roman Empire, its lise is gone, its
Emperor allows his wolves to destroy uS, and England
is too remote from Rome for his rule here to be effectual.
ln the powcrlcssness os its Emperor and the division

’ caused by the desire of the clergy ior secular power we
see the sulfilment of Daniel's prophecy (ii. 40 sq.).
Such an interpretation is not pleasing to our clergy,
who murmur against anyone who lays bare the sense of
¹'Scripture t0 their reprooi, sor the cause oi the whole
